  I sit on the British Standards Institute (BSI) ART1 Artificial Intelligence Committee as a National Expert contributing to standards on AI. I sit on committee at The Open Group contributing to professional standards in Ecosystems Architecture and AI. I have been a member of the University of London Data Science MSc academic tutor team teaching AI and Machine Learning. I am an IBM Certified Architect, IBM Certified AI Engineer, GCP Professional Cloud Architect, GCP Professional Machine Learning Engineer and certified in Data Science and Machine Learning (HarvardX). I am a Certified Information Systems Security Practitioner (CISSP, ISC2) and certified in Red Hat Openshift. 

  I have engineering and technical expertise in a wide range of technologies including training / GPU stacks (NVIDIA / Slurm / Ray / PyTorch amongst others) for HPC, HCI, databases, DevOps, building on self managed infrastructure and in the cloud. I graduated with First Class honours in Computer Science and hold a Masters degree from Cambridge University.
